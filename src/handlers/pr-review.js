PR: ${pr.url} (repo ${pr.owner}/${pr.repo}, PR #${pr.number})

Slack message (from @${mention.username ?? mention.user} in #${mention.channel?.name ?? "?"}):
"""
${mention.text}
"""
${contextBlock}${attachmentsBlock}
Workflow:
1. PRE-CHECK first: run \`gh api user --jq .login\` and \`gh pr view ${pr.number} --json author,state,isDraft,reviews,comments\`. STOP immediately and post nothing (REVIEW_COMMENTS: 0, explain in SLACK_REPLY) if ANY of these holds:
   - the PR author is me (never review my own PR),
   - I already submitted a review or comments on this PR (never double-review),
   - the PR is closed or merged.
2. You are in an isolated git worktree of this repository. Run \`gh pr checkout ${pr.number}\`, then \`gh pr diff ${pr.number}\` and \`gh pr view ${pr.number}\`. Read surrounding source files for full context — do not judge from the diff alone.
3. Review ONLY for real problems: bugs, regressions, lost data/functionality, broken API contracts, security issues, backward-compatibility breaks. SKIP minor issues entirely — style nits, naming, dead code, duplication notes, formatting, log wording. If unsure whether an issue is real, skip it.
4. Post findings as INLINE comments on the exact changed line (RIGHT side of the diff), all in ONE review call:
   \`gh api repos/${pr.owner}/${pr.repo}/pulls/${pr.number}/reviews -f event=COMMENT --input <json>\` where the JSON has a "comments" array of {path, line, side: "RIGHT", body}. Never post a single big summary comment instead of inline comments.
5. Every comment MUST include the fix as code: a \`\`\`suggestion block when the fix fits within the commented line(s); otherwise a short code snippet showing the fix.
6. Comment style: English with basic vocabulary, short clear sentences. State the problem, the impact, then the fix. No long paragraphs.
7. Comment-only review: do NOT approve, do NOT request changes.
8. If the PR has no real issues, post nothing at all.

End your final message with exactly these lines:
REVIEW_COMMENTS: <number of inline comments you posted, 0 if none>
SLACK_REPLY: <one short sentence in ${detectLang(mention.text) === "vi" ? "Vietnamese" : "English"} (match the language of the Slack message above, ignore the context block): if comments were posted, say you added review comments on the PR; if zero, say the PR looks good to you>`;
